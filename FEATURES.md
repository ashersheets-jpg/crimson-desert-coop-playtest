# Crimson Desert Seamless Co-op+ (alpha): features

Two-player co-op for Crimson Desert (Steam, game version 1.0.0.3527). Each of you plays in your own save;
your friend joins your world as their own character. Unofficial fan mod, built on Crimson Desert Multiplayer by
ByJunter and its port by nouzert1.

**How to read the Status column**
- **Works:** checked in the game on one PC against a stand-in second player. It should work, but a report from two
  real players still helps.
- **Needs testing:** built, but one PC can't show it. It needs two real players to confirm.
- **Not yet:** not possible in this version.

are made for you).
